}
```

## Project Structure
The project consists of two main classes:

### FlashcardDeck Class
- Core functionality for flashcard management

- Implements quiz logic
- Manages deck operations (add, update, delete)
- Handles JSON file imports

### FlashcardApp Class
- Implements the command-line interface
- Manages user interaction
- Displays menus and prompts
- Handles user input and validation

## Features in Detail
